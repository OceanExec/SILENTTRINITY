SILENTTRINITY is modern, asynchronous, multiplayer & multiserver C2/post-exploitation framework powered by Python 3 and .NETs DLR.

Some of the main features that distinguish SILENTTRINITY are:
- **Multi-User & Multi-Server** - Supports multi-user collaboration. Additionally, the client can connect to and control multiple Teamservers.
- **Client and Teamserver Built in Python 3.7** - Latest and greatest features of the Python language are used, heavy use of Asyncio provides ludicrous speeds.
- **Real-time Updates and Communication** - Use of Websockets allow for real-time communication and updates between the Client and Teamserver.
- **Focus on Usability with an Extremely Modern CLI** - Powered by [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit).
- **Dynamic Evaluation/Compilation Using .NET Scripting Languages** - The SILENTTRINITY implant [Naga](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Naga), is somewhat unique as it uses embedded third-party .NET scripting languages (e.g. [Boolang](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo)) to dynamically compile/evaluate tasks, this removes the need to compile tasks server side, allows for real-time editing of modules, provides greater flexibilty and stealth over traditional C# based payloads and makes everything much more light-weight.
- **ECDHE Encrypted C2 Communication** - SILENTTRINITY uses Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange to encrypt all C2 traffic between the Teamserver and its implant.
- **Fully Modular** - Listeners, Modules, Stagers and C2 Channels are fully modular allowing operators to easily build their own.
- **Extensive logging** - Every action is logged to a file.
- **Future proof** - HTTPS/HTTP listeners are built on [Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart) & [Hypercorn](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/hypercorn) which also support HTTP2 & Websockets.

## Call for Contributions

I'm just one person developing this mostly in my spare time, I do need to have a life outside of computers (radical idea, I know).

This means that if anyone finds this tool useful and would like to see X functionality added, the best way to get it added is to submit a Pull Request.

Be the change you want to see in the world!

As of the time of writing the most useful thing you can contribute are post-ex modules: this would allow me to concentrate efforts on the framework itself, user experience, QOL features etc...

To do this, you're going to have to learn the Boo programming language (the Boo [wiki](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo/wiki) is amazing and has everything you'd need to get started), if you know Python you'll find yourself at home :).

Check out some of the existing [modules](../master/core/teamserver/modules/boo), if you've written an [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) module before you'll see its very similar.
Finally you can start porting over post-ex modules from other C2 frameworks such as [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire).

## Setup & Requirements

- Python >= 3.7 is required.
- Client & Teamserver have only been tested on Mac & Linux systems, however they *should* work on Windows as well.

If your running a *nix system that has an older version of Python installed it is *highly* reccommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python >= 3.7.

### Ubuntu 18.04 setup

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git
curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
cat <<'EOF' >> ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
pyenv install 3.7-dev
git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY
cd SILENTTRINITY
pyenv local 3.7-dev
pip3 install pipenv && pipenv install && pipenv shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For Mac's, use Homebrew to install Python 3:
```bash
brew install python@3
```

Clone the repo and use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to install the dependencies for the Client & Teamserver:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY
pip3 install pipenv && pipenv install && pipenv shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Start a Teamserver, the default port is 5000:
```bash
python3 teamserver.py <teamserver_ip> <teamserver_password>
```

Connect to a Teamserver:

**Note the wss:// (two s's) in the URL which indicates an encrypted websocket connection (TLS), without this all traffic from the client to the teamserver will be in cleartext!**

```bash
python3 st.py wss://username:<teamserver_password>@<teamserver_ip>:5000
```

Alternatively, run ```st.py``` without any arguments and connect to a Teamserver manually using the CLI menu:
```
~# python3 st.py
[0] ST ≫ teamservers
[0] ST (teamservers) ≫ connect -h
Connect to the specified teamserver(s)

Usage: connect [-h] <URL>...

Arguments:
    URL   teamserver url(s)

[0] ST (teamservers) ≫ connect wss://username:<teamserver_password>@<teamserver_ip>:5000
```

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress but some is already available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY/wiki)

I recommend making wild use the ```help``` command and the ```-h``` flag :)
